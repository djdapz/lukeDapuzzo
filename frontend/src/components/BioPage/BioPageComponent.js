                    I'm Luke D'Apuzzo and I have been a musician my whole life. I originally started playing the drums
                    at
                    the age of 6 then after a few years moved to guitar. After that I started singing and playing bass
                    too and because fascinated in the idea of learning to record my own music. Currently I write my own
                    music and combine a modern rock sound with electronic elements and influences from a large variety
                    of genres to create a new sound of my own. Over the past few years I have been recording all of my
                    own songs on Ableton live playing the guitar, drums, bass, piano and singing my own tracks then
                    mixing them together.

                    Currently I've been trying to make a name for myself and am constantly writing new music. I always
                    wanted to be a musician for a profession and want my music to be heard and inspire the people who
                    listen to it. I am also a performer and have recently done a good amount of acoustic shows and
                    worked in a good amount of bands anywhere from drummer to lead singer and guitarist.
